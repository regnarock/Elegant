Elegant

###Introduction
Have you ever thought that, although git was a great and powerful tool, it is often overly complicated to use for simple actions ?
Elegant tries to address this issue by providing a very high level and user friendly interface to git. It aims to simplify managing your history and workflow.

Elegant *does not* try to supplant your usual git tool, or even your command-line. It is a secondary tool that you can use as a shortcut to all the common actions you usually do.
